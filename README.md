# AMS_ShaderLab
Unity3D project in which I implemented and tested all the techniques I studied during the development of my bachelor´s thesis: 
**[Implementation of different post-processing effects and NPR techniques using Unity3D](https://ams.xyz/dev/FinalDegreeProjectReport-AndrésValencia.pdf)**

Techniques implemented:
- Halftone post-processing effect
- Comic Shading
- Edge Detection
- Box/Gaussian Blur
- Bloom
- Depth of Field
- Color Grading
- Tone Mapping
- Automatic ¨smear frames¨ generation
- Oil painting post-processing effect
- Multi-resolution Screen Space Ambient Occlusion

I also used some assets from Unity´s Asset Store for better display of the techniques previously mentioned:
- [Shader Calibration Scene](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/25422)
- [Corridor Lighting Example](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/33630)
- [¨Unity-chan!¨ Model](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/18705)
- [Shader Forge](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/14147)

All the source code for the techniques implemented (from scripts and editor scripts to shaders) is located under the path: **[Assets/Resources/Research](https://github.com/amsgames94/AMS_ShaderLab/tree/master/Assets/Resources/Research)**
